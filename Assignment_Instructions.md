# Create a Springboot Web App

## Springboot web app with Thymeleaf and 1 DB table

### 1.
> Create a table for storing product data.<br />
> (For example for a Toy store)

### 2.
> Create a page with a form in Springboot <br />
> That allows you to add new Products to the table


### 3.
> Create a page that allows you to list all the Products in the store<br />
> It should show, line by line, the relevant information about your product<br />
> (this could be all the product information in the case of a table with just a few fields, or the more important fields like name, price, stock in the case of a big table<br />


### 4.
> In the list add a delete Link, when clicked that Request should delete the specified<br />
> Product from the database
> Each line of the table list should have it's own delete link

### 5. (Bonus)
> In the list add a Edit Link<br />
> When clicked it should take you to a pre-filled form that allows you to change and save the specific Product information
> Can edit all fields, except if not technically viable, for example, the Primary Key.
